## Introduction

This document describes how to serve the `T5` model by FasterTransformer Triton backend. This backend is only an interface to call FasterTransformer in Triton. All implementation are in [FasterTransformer repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer). 

## Setup Environment

Follow the guide in [`README.md`](../README.md) to setup the environment and prepare docker image. We assume users already build the docker here.

### How to set the model configuration

In T5 triton backend, the serving configuration is controlled by `config.pbtxt`. We provide an example in `all_models/t5/fastertransformer/config.pbtxt`. It contains the input parameters, output parameters, some other settings like `tensor_para_size` and `model_checkpoint_path`. 

We use the `config.ini` in the `model_checkpoint_path` to control the model hyper-parameters like head number, head size and transformer layers. We also provide an example in `all_models/t5/fastertransformer/1/config.ini` which assume we set the `model_checkpoint_path` as `all_models/t5/fastertransformer/1/`. The `config.ini` will generated by checkpoint converter when user convert model. User can also change the setting to run tests on custom model size to benchmark.  

The following table shows the details of these settings:

* Settings in config.pbtxt

### Prepare Triton T5 model store

Following the guide [#setup](../README.md#setup) to prepare the docker image.

Download T5 model checkpoint:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --gpus=all -v ${WORKSPACE}:${WORKSPACE} -w ${WORKSPACE} ${TRITON_DOCKER_IMAGE} bash
# now in docker
export WORKSPACE=$(pwd)

git lfs clone https://huggingface.co/t5-small
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer.git # To convert checkpoint
python3 FasterTransformer/examples/pytorch/t5/utils/huggingface_t5_ckpt_convert.py \
        -in_file t5-small/ \
        -saved_dir ${WORKSPACE}/all_models/t5/fastertransformer/1/ \
        -inference_tensor_para_size 1
```

We need to convert to format handled by FasterTransformer. 
If you want to run the model with tensor parallel size 4 and pipeline parallel size 2,
you should convert checkpoints with `-inference_tensor_para_size = [tensor_para_size], i.e. -inference_tensor_para_size = 4`. 
We will convert it directly to directory structure which later we'd use as Triton model store.

Then we will get the model weights (`xxx.bin`) and the config file of model (`config.ini`) in the `${WORKSPACE}/all_models/t5/fastertransformer/1/1-gpu/`. The `config.ini` file contains the hyper-parameters of both encoder and decoder. Note that user need to change the `model_checkpoint_path` to `${WORKSPACE}/all_models/t5/fastertransformer/1/1-gpu/`.

## Run Serving on Single Node

### Run serving directly

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 mpirun -n 1 --allow-run-as-root /opt/tritonserver/bin/tritonserver  --model-repository=${WORKSPACE}/all_models/t5/ &
python3 tools/t5_utils/t5_end_to_end_test.py --batch_size 32
```

The results would be like

```bash
[INFO] ft_triton translates 24 batches taking 8.94 sec to translate 61374 tokens, BLEU score: 27.26, 6862 tokens/sec.
```

* Note: If user encounter `[ERROR] world_size (4) should equal to tensor_para_size_ * pipeline_para_size_ (1 * 1 here)`, please check that the GPU number of your device and set the GPUs you want to use by `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. 
* Recommend modifying the SERVER_TIMEOUT of common/util.sh to longer time

### Issue request directly

```bash
python3 ${WORKSPACE}/tools/issue_request.py tools/requests/sample_request_single_t5.json
```

## Run Triton server on multiple nodes

### Prepare Triton model store for multi-node setup

For this experiment you need to [prepare Triton t5 model store](#prepare-triton-t5-model-store):
- properly convert the checkpoint to FasterTransformer format
- update Triton model configuration

We do suggest:
- `tensor_para_size` = number of gpus in one node (e.g. 8 for DGX A100)
- `layer_para_size` = number of nodes

Other Triton model configuration parameters should be updated as for single node setup.

Model store should be placed on network file system available for all cluster nodes on which Triton will run.

### Run on cluster with Enroot/Pyxis support

First allocate two nodes:

```bash
salloc -A account_name -t 10:00:00 -N 2
```

Then run the script shown below to start two nodes' server.
-N and -n should be equal to the number of nodes because we start one process per node. If you need to run on two nodes, then -N 2 and -n 2.
Remember to change `tensor_para_size` and `pipeline_para_size` as suggested in [MPI Launching with Tensor Parallel size/ Pipeline Parallel Size Setting](../README.md#mpi-launching-with-tensor-parallel-size-and-pipeline-parallel-size-setting) if you run on multiple nodes. 

```bash
WORKSPACE="/workspace" # the dir you build the docker
IMAGE="github_or_gitlab/fastertransformer/multi-node-ft-triton-backend:latest"
CMD="/opt/tritonserver/bin/tritonserver --model-repository=$WORKSPACE/fastertransformer_backend/all_models/t5"
srun -N 2 -n 2 --mpi=pmix -o inference_server.log \
               --container-mounts /home/account/your_network_shared_space/triton:/workspace \
               --container-name multi-node-ft-triton \
               --container-image $IMAGE \
               bash -c "$CMD"
```

Then, you need to run the server on the background since it will not detach by itself. You can enter and commands `ctrl D` and `bg` or run the script above with `sbatch`.

Next, enter the master triton node (the node where MPI_Rank = 0, normally it is the allocated node with the smallest id) when servers have been started shown in the inference log:

```bash
srun -w master-node-name --overlap \
                         --container-name multi-node-ft-triton \
                         --container-mounts /home/account/your_network_shared_space/triton:/workspace \
                         --pty bash # --overlap may not be needed in your slurm environment
```

Finally, run the client in the master triton node:

```bash
python3 fastertransformer_backend/tools/t5_utils/t5_end_to_end_test.py --batch_size 32
```

You can refer to `inference_server.log` on the login-node for the inference server log.
